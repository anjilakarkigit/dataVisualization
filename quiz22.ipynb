        "This presentation appeals to me much. The graphic representation of this topic is both fascinating and extensive. A lot of things are going on in the background. I enjoy how they use pictures to describe the many types of ACEs. It also has statistics. The graphic also illustrates four states' rates in comparison to the national average, as well as their state lows and highs in relation to ACEs reported. The graph, in my opinion, supports the project's entire goal."
